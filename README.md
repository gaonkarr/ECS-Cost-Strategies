# Strategies for cost driven architectures


This is a reference architecture that shows the evolution of a Node.js application from a monolithic
application that is deployed directly onto instances with no containerization or orchestration, to a
containerized microservices architecture orchestrated using Amazon EC2 Container Service.


## Node.js Microservices Deployed on EC2 Container Service

This is a sample demonstration of how to implement strategies for implementing cost driven architectures.

In this sample, we will implement some of the strategies discussed here into a Microservices Nodejs sample application. Lets call it Old (pre-applying some of these strategies) and New/Updated(after implementing strategies).

For deployment follow steps in each folder : 

- [Part One: The old microservices deployment](01-old-microservices/)
- [Part Two: The new/updated microservices deployment](02-new-microservices/)



## Some of the common strategies are listen below :

__Rightsizing:__

__Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting:__

__Match capacity with demand:__

__Choose right pricing model:__

__Expenditure and Usage Awareness:__
